# village: bringing neighbors together
village is a location-based mobile application that encourages giving and receiving acts of charity

# About village
The idea for village was born in a re-purposed, industrial warehouse in Queens, New York. Our mission is to address the obscenely disparate income levels of New Yorkers by providing a fast and efficient way to give and receive acts of kindness.
